E-Commerce Backend - ProDev BE
E-Commerce Backend
Real-World Application
The e-commerce backend simulates a real-world development environment, emphasizing scalability, security, and performance. Participants will: - Design and optimize relational database schemas. - Build and document APIs for frontend integration. - Enhance backend performance through query optimization and indexing.

Overview
This case study focuses on developing a robust backend system to support an e-commerce product catalog. The backend will handle product data management, user authentication, and APIs for filtering, sorting, and pagination, simulating a real-world scenario for backend engineers.

Project Goals
CRUD APIs: Build APIs for managing products, categories, and user authentication.
Filtering, Sorting, Pagination: Implement robust logic for efficient product discovery.
Database Optimization: Design a high-performance database schema to support seamless queries.
Technologies Used
Django: For building a scalable backend framework.
PostgreSQL: As the relational database for optimized performance.
JWT: For secure user authentication.
Swagger/OpenAPI: To document and test APIs.
Key Features
1. CRUD Operations
Create, read, update, and delete operations for products and categories.
User authentication and management features using JWT.
2. API Features
Filtering and Sorting: Allow users to filter products by category and sort by price.
Pagination: Implement paginated responses for large product datasets.
3. API Documentation
Use Swagger or Postman to generate API documentation.
Publish hosted API docs for easy frontend consumption.
Implementation Process
Git Commit Workflow
feat: set up Django project with PostgreSQL
feat: implement user authentication with JWT
feat: add product APIs with filtering and pagination
feat: integrate Swagger documentation for API endpoints
perf: optimize database queries with indexing
docs: add API usage instructions in Swagger
Submission Details
API Deployment: Host the API with documentation published (e.g., Swagger or Postman).
